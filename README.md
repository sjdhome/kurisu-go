# kurisu

紅莉栖(kurisu), just the name of this project.

It aims to be a universal platform of my ideas, including blog, terminal, forum, etc.

Everything it required will be packed into binary file, so it can be deployed anywhere without requiring any other dependencies. There is no need for Docker, Nginx, Database, etc.
